## Google Drive API
1. Install [PyDrive](https://github.com/gsuitedevs/PyDrive).
2. Start a project on [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com)
3. At *Credentials* page, *Create credentials* of *OAuth client ID* with type *Other* and download **client_secret_[something].apps.googleusercontent.com.json**.
4. Rename the downloaded file to **client_secrets.json** and place it under `server/` folder.
5. Run `server/GoogleAuth.py` with desktop environment ( or VNC ) to authenticate the permission of uploading files to your google drive. This step generates a file called **myAuth.pkl**.
